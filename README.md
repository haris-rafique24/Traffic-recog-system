# Traffic-recog-system
This project is a part of an internship done by me from The SPARKS Foundation, which is based on computer vision and IOT. For this task, I used a relatively small training set as compared to the one available on Kaggle (link given in description). This Machine Learning model basically classifies different types of traffic signs fed into the network and displays the output in the form of images with their respective labels.
